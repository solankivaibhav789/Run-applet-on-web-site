Now a days java applet is not properly support on web browser.
because of certificate issue
why browser not give certificate for this?
because when applet run than it create its own control, its not have under browser.

Goal->
So over team goal is that find out way to support java file in web browser.
We find AjaxSwing.
AjaxSwing is a web deployment platform for Java Swing applications. 
It allows companies that built Java desktop applications to run them as web applications.

How it works->

1) AjaxSwing is a deployment platform that automatically converts Java Swing and AWT applications into AJAX web applications at runtime.
2) It can be thought of as a runtime Java to HTML converter that migrates Java desktop applications to web applications. 
   AjaxSwing is unique in that it requires virtually no modifications to existing applications, 
   and does not require programmers to learn any APIs other then AWT/Swing. 
3) The same application can run as thick Swing client or as a browser-based thin AJAX RIA, giving dual client solution to Java.


Apache Tomcat
